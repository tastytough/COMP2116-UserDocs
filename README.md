# Overview of MySQL User Documentation

Welcome! :wave: This guide is designed to help you get started with [**MySQL**](https://www.mysql.com/), a popular open-source relational database management system.

This guide will walk you through the essential steps of setting up a MySQL environment with [**MySQL Workbench**](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/), creating your database schema and tables, and performing basic data querying using SELECT statements.

## Who this guide is for

- Beginners to MySQL interested in learning about databases.
- Full-stack web development students or anyone looking to set up a backend for personal projects.
- Software development teams working on small to medium-sized web applications.

## Collaboration process

This user docs assignment is for our in-person course. Even talked and planned our guide together in person, we also used Discord to talk and share ideas when we weren't in class. After coming up with ideas, we used Git and GitHub to work on the guide together. We made a new branch for every new part of the guide. This kept our work organized until we were ready to put it all together in the main part of the project.

## How we created our guide

We made our guide based on what we learned from working with MySQL in our COMP2350 Web Database Technologies. We used the official [MySQL Workbench Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/) to enhance our practical understanding. We also reflected on challenges faced during our work with MySQL and lab assignments to ensure our instructions complete, used emphasis, headers, admonitions to make our documentation both clear and concise.

### Using MkDocs

We used MkDocs to serve our MySQL User Documentation online because we like the Markdown's theme, template, and components from [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/). We also experienced Markdown's references and added an extra css file to make our documentation more stunning.

### Using Markdown

For all of us in the group, this project was our first deep dive into writing a lot in markdown. We picked up Markdown styling tips from Markdown Tutorial and got better at it as we worked on this guide.

### Using VS Code

We used VS Code to create all of our documentation files because we like the MkDocs' themes, and it's easy to use but it brings effective output for our documentation. We tried to experience [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/) in our documentation. We also added on some plugins and extra css file to make it more stunning. 

## Learning best practices for Web Writing

Nowadays, much of the writing that developers produce is intended for the web. This emphasizes the need for creating documents optimized for online readability and engagement.

## Conclusion

This quide reflects our understanding of introduction to MySQL, that we mastered during the initial weeks of our Web Database Technologies course. While introducing MySQL now comes easily to us, we remember the challenges we faced, such as struggling with data types, SELECT statements, and ERDs, at first. With this documentation, we aim to support those who are just beginning their journey with MySQL or looking to learn more about it.

This project gave us a great chance to get better at writing and to see how well we work as a team. It helped us learn to explain tech stuff in an easy way and also showed us how to work together, talk things out, and solve problems as a group.

We appreciate your interest in our Introduction to MySQL Documentation! :heart:
