## MySQL Workbench

1.  Open MySQL Workbench
    It will look like this when you open it:

    ![MySQL Workbench](./assets/MySQLWorkbench.png){ width="500" }

    !!! note
    The MySQL Workbench interface is consistent across both Windows and Mac platforms, therefore, this documentation will not differentiate between the two.

    If you don't have any connections under MySQL Connections, you can create a new one by **clicking** on ![plus button](./assets/plusButton.png){ width="20" } button

    **Enter** a connection name and leave all defaults. **Click** Ok

    ![Creating a new connection](./assets/newConnection.png){ width="500" }

    !!! tips
    You can click on Test Connection button before pressing Ok to see if it works. It will ask for your root password.

2.  Open your connection by **double clicking** on it and enter your root password.
    Once open it will look like this

    ![MySQL Workbench](./assets/Workbench.png){ width="500" }

    The MySQL Workbench interface features four primary areas:

    - The Schema (or Database) Section, located at the right, displays all the databases, tables, views, procedures, and functions.
    - At the top, the Query Section is where queries are entered or SQL files are opened. The lightning bolt icon with cursor ![Lightning Bolt button with cursor](./assets/lightningbutton.png){ width="20" } allows for the execution of individual queries.
    - Results from executed queries, such as SELECT or SHOW TABLES commands, are shown in the Result Grid directly below the Query Section.
    - Additional information about executed queries is found in the Output Section, including the number of rows returned, execution time, or errors, along with hints for correcting syntax issues.

3.  Practice Time!
    In the Query type the following command:
    `SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'version';`
    and **click** ![Lightning Bolt button with cursor](./assets/lightningbutton.png){ width="20" }.

    !!! info
    The MYSQL keywords are **case insensitive**, so you can type it both lowercase and uppercase (ex. show variables like 'version';).

!!! success
The result should look like this:

    ![Query result](./assets/ShowVersion.png){ width="500" }
